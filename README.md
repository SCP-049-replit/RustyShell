![rust logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg/240px-Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg.png)

The new and improved version of the [PyLine Terminal](https://replit.com/@SCP-049/PyLine-Terminal?v=1)!

The RustyShell is made to be the continuation of my old project, but written in a new programming language im trying to learn!

Below this is section is how to set up the shell, the commands more in-depth, and the roadmap for the shell!

> Note: Still trying to re-add all the old features, so nothing new until it's all ported. (Unless I find something cool)

# Setup

Unlike the PyLine Terminal, installing dependencies is easy thanks to rusts Cargo package manager! All *you* need to do is to install it, and move to the Shell's directory and run it!

1. Install Rust: Visit [rust.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to find out how to install! (Make sure to install everythin!)
